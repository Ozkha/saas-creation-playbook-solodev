__Main Question:__ 
How can I efficiently source product ideas, validate and develop a SaaS offering, and expand my customer base to achieve profitability as a solo developer?

__Reserach Questions:__ 
- How to create a profitable Software as a Service product as a solo developer?
- How to know if my SaaS idea is worth my efforts a a solo developer?
- How to efficiently  build, test and get product ideas when trying to reach a profitable SaaS product as a solo developer?
- How can i grow my customers portfolio as a solo developer

__Motivation:__
I've seen posts on subreddits where developers share how difficult it was to acquire even one customer for their SaaS products. In the worst cases, it took them 1-2 years. In my opinion, that's inefficient and makes it hard to stay motivated—especially since even after all that time, profitability isn’t guaranteed.

I want a reliable, step-by-step process with clear timelines to quickly determine whether a SaaS product has the potential to be profitable.


# SaaS solo Dev Mindset

- Don’t try to compete with free tools unless your paid features offer 10x value. <sup>[8]</sup>
- Accept failures → Sometimes you need to accept setbacks that sometimes is not in your hand. <sup>[10]</sup>
- Expect it all to fail <sup>[19]</sup>
    - Sadistically speaking, you will fail.
    - In that case, make sure that all of this wouldn’t be for nothing. Create as many reusable building blocks. Make your own framework. Save as much reusable code.
- Embrace the critics from the users, and learn from it. <sup>[1]</sup>
- Don’t let your rejection sensibility drive your decision making. Sometimes the person you’re trying to sell doesn’t really need/want your product <sup>[15]</sup>

# Problem Identification & Seeking

**Problem-Founder-Fit**

- The first thing to do is look for a problem that’s good for me as a founder. (Problem-Founder-Fit) Are yourself the Ideal Customer Profile? <sup>[19]</sup>
- Make sure you are passionate about the the problem, because there’s going to be a lot of struggles and emotional roller coaster ahead of me as a founder. <sup>[19]</sup>
- Write down all the problems you currently have yourself that you would love to have solve. then list down all the problem domains that you’re particularly excited and passionate about. <sup>[19]</sup>
- Scratch your own itches. Look around you, and look some boring, annoying or something you don’t like. Try to solve your own pain. You already validate your own pain. <sup>[20]</sup>.

**Third Parties**

- Discover a high value problem by just finding what people struggle with on Reddit (or any post) <sup>[14]</sup>
- Focus on people who are: <sup>[4]</sup>
    - Actively searching for a solution
    - Frustrated with existing options
    - Asking for recommendations.
- Instead of cold DM’S, search for post like “anyone know a tool that…” or “frustrated with [competitor]”. <sup>[4]</sup>

# Validation

## Problem Validation

- Search discussions, review websites, groups related to what you plan building. Contact those people asking for 5-10 minutes. Eventually pay them. The part of reaching people: Ask questions, What are your problems, how you solve them, what else you tried etc. Don’t speak too much, don’t try to pitch your idea. (Practice listening beforehand eventually) <sup>[14]</sup>
- The problem you are seeking needs to be a problem in demand to make sure there’s a market for what you’re building and the people actually want the tool you’re going to build. <sup>[19]</sup>
- You may create a survey with 6-8 questions about the problem (Founders failing to build successful products) and shared it in communities with founders. <sup>[23]</sup>

## Idea/Product/Solution Validation

- Find people ALREADY looking for a solution <sup>[4]</sup>
- Sell the skeleton → Narrow down your focus on the core value proposition and sell as aggressively as you can to validate with minimal setup. Sell a MVP essentially <sup>[10]</sup>
- Define a clear solution to a problem you’re solving. <sup>[23]</sup>

**Before Building**

- Talk to people (people that would be your target audience of your product) before building.<sup>[2]</sup>
    - Through a Community Channels.
    - Asked them for feedback on your idea and tried to understand their process and pain points better (through survey)
    - Offer to give them feedback in return for responding (to give and inventive to respond). — Do not try to promote your product, seek for feedback.
- Your early users are people with their head on fire, and looking for a immediate solution, such people will not only try your product but also be following it before development if you make them aware of it. (Also works as marketing) <sup>[7]</sup>
- Do not waste months building something no one wants. <sup>[2]</sup>
- If people are willing yo pay. Its a sign that you can build it <sup>[23]</sup>
- Get a waitlist → “Build it and they will come” Rarely happens. Build a small waitlist or community (who is genuinely interested) before the MVP was done (Even before the product exists, just a landing page with a clear problem + solution works). <sup>[7]</sup>

**Product Build (… or partially build)**

*Read Product Building section, before this.*

- Whether a problem is real or not can be evaluated based on users. <sup>[8]</sup>
- Leading with help, not sales. Your first message is usually answering their question thoroughly. Only AFTER providing value did your mention “I actually built a tool that might help…” <sup>[4]</sup>
- An idea can be validated through the usage of the MVP. <sup>[9]</sup>
- You can create a prototype and send it to the potential TG user for feedback. <sup>[14]</sup>

# Product Building

- Iterate → Don’t try to build something perfect. Build something that works and solves a problem <sup>[16]</sup>.

**Unfair Advantage**

- Whare are your unfair advantages? (Passion about the problem and knowing who are your ICP counts as unfair advantages) <sup>[19]</sup>

**Initial Building**

- Build for a specific pain point <sup>[4]</sup>
- Do one thing well. <sup>[4]</sup>
- Don’t build everything → You should value agility and try and get solutions and services that can integrate with your core product and make it more valuable. <sup>[10]</sup>
- Include a metrics analytical, head map, and other user observability tools. <sup>[M]</sup>
- Build a simple version of your app. Build SLC apps: <sup>[18]</sup>
    - Simple: It doesn’t have to do everything. Deliver on the 1-2 key features.
    - Lovable: Make people LOVE using your product. Good UI/UX is key.
    - Complete: Ship something usable at launch. Aim to ship version 1.0 of something simple rather than a version 0.1 of something complex.
- Ship only one feature. One feature you cannot remove. Most of the features build won’t be used by the users. <sup>[20]</sup>

**Based on feedback**

- (You need to relentlessly gather feedback from your users and use it to improve) <sup>[18]</sup>
- Work  on the MVP based on the feedback. <sup>[2]</sup>
- Use the feedback of your product users to improve the product <sup>[2]</sup>.
- Try to make meaningfull changes every two weeks (based on users behaviour and feedback) an then test an repeat <sup>[5]</sup>
- Not all feedback is created equal you need to focus on what matters so use the following criteria to prioritaze feedback: <sup>[18]</sup>
    - Frecuency: Based on the frecuencia you get the same pieces of feedback. If the same issue keep getting mentioned is probably worth addressing.
    - Feasability: How easy or difficult is it to implement, if it’s quick win, implement it right away.
    - Impact. How much real value does it bring to your users.
- Establish a constant feedback loop, watch their behaviour closely to see where they’re spending time or getting stuck, and fix bugs immediately. <sup>[24]</sup>

# Launch & Post-Launch

- Start reaching your customers. Day 3-5 is the seet spot for the first feedback when impressions are still fresh. <sup>[24]</sup>
    - If you have analytics installed on your product t osee how your customers are using it, personalize your feedback outreach based on their engagement. <sup>[24]</sup>
    - In your feedback conversations, ask “What were you trying to do?” and “Why did you sign up?” not “What features do you want?” <sup>[24]</sup>
    - Set up a dead-simple way to them to reach you directly. Maybe add a feedback floater button on the bottom right of your product making it easy for them to reach out, because friction kills feedback. <sup>[24]</sup>

## **Lean Launch (Usage of the product but probably to big pivot)**

- Launch early → Shipping earlier and getting real user feedback would have saved you efforts applied on guesswork. <sup>[7]</sup>
- Involve actual users soon enough → Don’t forget to ask real users if they even need that feature.<sup>[7]</sup>
- Iteration beats perfection → One launched, users would use your product in unexpected ways that will you lead to pivot. Embrace a “test quickly, pivot if needed”, don’t over-engeenering. <sup>[7]</sup>
- Update quickly and often. <sup>[18]</sup>
- You may always made a point of talking to users. Have calls with users every week where you could ask them questions to try understand them better and most importantly, understand how you can improve the product for them. <sup>[23]</sup>

**Discussion with your potential ICP** <sup>[3]</sup>

The idea is to aim to prove “demand”. (30 min)

1. What is the pain point they are trying to solve (within your problem space). How would they articulate it?
2. What is the “urgency” or “priority” of solving this pain point. Remember that most pain points will not be solved, only the top priority ones.
3. Are they currently trying to solve it? if yes, (great) how? How is your solution better?
4. How would they define success if their pain point is solved.

Unless you have a clear answer to the above, it will hard to continue scaling beyond first few clients (who could just be from your network)

## **Oficial Launch (Less probability to big pivot)**

- Once you have like 100 users and you’ve improve the MVP, it’s time for the official launch. <sup>[23]</sup>
- Spend 99% of the time on product. <sup>[23]</sup>
    - After getting a bunch of users, you could shift to spend literally 99% of your time on the product. <sup>[23]</sup>
    - A good product really is the foundation for everything. <sup>[23]</sup>
    - Make sure you have an awesome product because that will take you further than anything. <sup>[23]</sup>

# Business Model & Monetization

- Start charging immediately. Have a monetization model from day one. <sup>[4]</sup>
- Free plans don’t really work for solo ‘preneurs because most free users actually never convert to pay customers, also that subscriptions are much harder to sell than onetime payment. <sup>[20]</sup>
- Avoid freemium tiers. <sup>[21]</sup>
    - Forever freemium user plans could kill you. <sup>[21]</sup> You don’t have unlimited founds <sup>[21]</sup>
    - If needed take a free trail. <sup>[21]</sup>
- Avoid subscription plan. <sup>[21]</sup>
    - conversion rate of one-time payment is larger than subscription plan payments.
- Doesn’t matter if you have a ton of free users if they don’t even pay you. <sup>[21]</sup>

# Marketing, Sales & User Acquisition.

(Once you app is “ready”, you need to attract users and convert them into customers) <sup>[18]</sup>

(Make clear to the possible customer understands what is getting) <sup>[20]</sup>

(Never stop marketing, Try to keep a small drumbeat going even with just 5 users to build momentum for finding your next 5) <sup>[24]</sup>

Marketing is just as important as building <sup>[8]</sup>

Start selling as soon as possible <sup>[16]</sup>.

Sometimes the best marketing strategy isn’t about being everywhere - it’s about being real in the right place. People that actually cared about the problem you are solving. <sup>[11]</sup>

## “Ready-to-buy” Framework.

Focus on people who are: <sup>[4]</sup>

- Actively searching for a solution
- Frustrated with existing options
- Asking for recommendations.

## Landing Page design

- Ensure your landing page UI/UX clarify the value proposition of your product, simplify the message and make the user Journey Crystal clear. <sup>[1]</sup>
- Ensure your landing page is targeting your target audience. <sup>[1]</sup>
- The landing page is crucial to make the convert. Certain components are key to converts: Problem Agitation (showing you resolve the customer pain). Headline is the promise you make to your customers. Social Proof. Product Demo (in video). Your product/startup name. <sup>[20]</sup>
- Design FOR someone not AT someone. (This ensure your work is empathic, and truthy useful). <sup>[5]</sup>
    - Talk about the value proposition.

## User Acquisition

Every user acquisition have a method (How the users is reached), channel (where the user is reached) and a cost (The price of reaching the user) <sup>[22]</sup>

### Methods of getting users. <sup>[22]</sup>

- Incoming. The users finds you and signs themself up (Or initiate contact). Them become aware of your product.
- Outgoing. You reach out the user and make a sale.  The initial contact is in you side (Ex. you initiate the conversation).
- Referrals. The users brings in new users (Who then brings in new users).
- Advertising. Similar to incoming, but you pay to get in front of the user and make them aware of your product.

### Channels

- Reddit & Twitter → Posting about their problem, engaging in comments, and sharing insights. <sup>[3]</sup>
- Cold DM’s & Emails → Simple messages like, “I built something that solves X. Want to try it?” <sup>[3]</sup>
    - In cold channels. Talk about how it can save time/make money, don’t talk about what it is. <sup>[5]</sup>
    - Unless your list is incredibly target and your messages are highly personalized. Cold Emails is not the channel i would use if you are just starting. If you haven’t even marketed your SaaS, you probably don’t understand your messaging. <sup>[13]</sup>
    - I think you are better off finding where your customers hang out, engaging with them, talking about the problem, and then building your messaging from what you learn. <sup>[13]</sup>
    - It is popular said that cold emails are the worst way to understand which messages resonate since the signals are so rare and weak. <sup>[13]</sup>
- Niche Slack & Discord Groups → Offering early access in industry communities. <sup>[3]</sup>
- Affiliate & Referral Deals → Giving early users and incentive to bring friends. <sup>[3]</sup>
- LinkedIn Outreach → Connecting with ideal customers and starting conversations. <sup>[3]</sup>
- YouTube → Putting/Mentioning your SaaS in some videos of your YouTube Channel. Videos designed to solve a problem or save the watcher a lot of time. <sup>[3]</sup>
- Product Hunt. <sup>[2]</sup>
- HackerNews platform. <sup>[20]</sup>
- SEO → Don’t try SEO in the beginnings… this takes months/year. <sup>[4]</sup>
    - Use it for first paying customers <sup>[16]</sup>
    - This takes time, but writing valuable content about your space (answering pain points, user case studies, etc.) helps bring in consistent traffic. <sup>[17]</sup>
- Ads → Stop spending money on ads. Start reaching out to makers and small brands with a personal message. <sup>[5]</sup>
- Personal network. You might know someone, or someone might know someone that could into that target demographic. <sup>[17]</sup>
- Beta Groups / Private communities. Creating a small, engaged user base — like an invite-only group where people feel exclusive access — can build strong early traction <sup>[17]</sup>
    - Create your own space — Build your own discord and invite interested users naturally. <sup>[17]</sup>

### User scrapping

Your first users to try and validate the product.

**Scrappy Marketing** <sup>[23]</sup>

- Realize where is handing your target audience (Ex. Twitter, Reddit, a specific forum) specially in communities like build in public and startup. <sup>[23]</sup>
- Make continuous activity in that channel. Don’t spam low content value — no one will check out your product. <sup>[23]</sup>
- You have to actually help people. The good thing is that you have probably build a product around a topic that you understand. (If not, learn more and them build a product letter) <sup>[23]</sup>
- … this method is hard work and it doesn’t scale but you have to start somewhere to get those first users. <sup>[23]</sup>

**Others**

If you joined to relevant servers (Reddit, Discrod, etc.), participate and offer value before mentioning your product. <sup>[17]</sup> Contribute, don’t pitch. Focus on conversations, not sales; Mention your tool only when relevant. <sup>[17]</sup> and Provide value, share insights, help others, nad make your presence valuable. [17]. (Keep it organic and people will come to you) <sup>[17]</sup>

Spread the world of your launch, try not to make it to salesy, tell your story in a genuine way what inspires you to make the product. <sup>[18]</sup>

Create one organic distribution channel (…that you could use to reach users) <sup>[19]</sup>

---

( 0 - 5 users) <sup>[22]</sup>

Channel: DM’s, Emails or whatever messaging app.

You are going yo use your close network, family, friends, collegues, people who you know persoanlly who you belive would benefit from your product. (You have an MVP ready) All you will ask in return is their feedback. <sup>[22]</sup>

Make sure to include them all in a small community either a Discord, etc. <sup>[22]</sup>

Before advance to the next step, you want to spend a lot of time wit this handful of new users listen to their feedback. This users are the most important ones. <sup>[22]</sup>

### User growing

You already have a product/solution validated and want to grow.

( 5 - 100 users) <sup>[22]</sup>

Channel: Referral links.

---

(500 - 1k users) <sup>[22]</sup>

Channel: Social media & search engines.

The best way to get users using the incoming method is by creating content and building in public.

This works. It just takes time.

---

( 1k ++ users) <sup>[22]</sup>

Channel: Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads.

Take all the content to prove right in the stage 2 and transform them into paid Ads that you can scale and reach a new level or awareness. (Craft, test and scale new Ad creatives and trying out new strategies)
